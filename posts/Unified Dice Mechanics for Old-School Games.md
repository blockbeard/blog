Recently the topic has come up on the [Sly Flourish](https://slyflourish.com/)Discord that OSR systems can be a bit of a mess with resolution mechanics compared to more modern games, it is a topic I've thought about before. I have never liked the thief skills from early editions with their awkward sometimes a d6 sometimes a d100 system. I even have an unpublished B/X hack where I attempted to resolve it, though after writing this post I have changed my mind on it being a better system. 

The questions are:

Does it matter?

and

If it does can we fix it?

## Does it Matter?

I think it does. Whether you enjoy it or not I think a lot of the appeal of D&D 5e comes down to the fact that the primary resolution mechanic is to roll a d20 and that a higher number is better. You can follow an actual play show and understand roughly what is going on just by knowing this one mechanic.

I am nearly two years into a [Dolmenwood](https://necroticgnome.com/collections/dolmenwood) campaign and we don't roll a lot of dice outside of combat, but when we do it still takes a minute to remember which mechanic we should be using and how it works.

## Can we fix it?

Yes, but it isn't as simple as it sounds and most of the solutions have trade-offs that you may or may not like.

Before I go any further, I'm really talking about early D&D and its clones, original D&D, B/X, OSE etc. with the intent that a system would allow you to pick up a module for one of these games and you would be able to run it without much, if any, conversion. If I cover every possible system this post will end up so long that I don't want to write it and you wouldn't want to read it.

To make a simple system that is accessible to inexperienced players I want to unify the resolution mechanic into a single dice type where either high or low is always good. For the sake of tradition and approachability I think a d20 roll high mechanic is best. I also want to keep the probabilities of success and failure about the same as B/X (the 1981 Basic/Expert sets by Frank Mentzer) to maintain game balance.

Taking B/X as our example there are four rolls we need to be able to replicate:

- Attack Rolls

- Saving Throws

- Ability Checks

- Skill Checks

## The Original and the Clone

Early D&D editions used essentially the same system, clarified in [Old School Essentials](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Main_Page), and an excellent place to make sense of the earlier editions. These allow the use of old modules essentially unmodified. Their answers are:

### Attack Rolls

They have two options, THAC0/Attack Matrices with descending armour class or d20 + modifier against an ascending armour class.

Either way you roll a d20, higher is better against a target based on the enemy armour class.

### Saving Throws

Roll a d20 meet or exceed a target number on your character sheet.

### Ability Checks

d20, roll under a number on your character sheet.

### Skill Checks

A mess, some are a d6, some are percentile.

### Conclusion

A bit of a mess, sometimes we roll a d20, sometimes we roll other dice, sometimes high is good sometimes low is good.

We know it works. The enduring popularity of B/X and its clones demonstrates that many people like it, or at least have become used to it, but it is not elegant modern game design.

## Fixing it

I have ideas, but they all have their own problems. I will generally assume we are going to use a system of d20 + bonus to beat an AC for attack rolls, it works and it makes the key mechanic familiar.

## Roll high versus set target

Make ability checks and skill checks into a system like saving throws where there is a target number on your sheet and you need to meet or exceed it on a d20.

#### Pro

- Saving throws are unchanged.

- Skills need to be converted to a d20 target number which throws off the maths a little due to rounding but generally works.

- No conversion needed, old modules work as is.

#### Con

- Ability checks need to be reversed. Either reworking the ability system so low is better and changing the bonuses appropriately, or by subtracting them from 21 to get an array of target numbers

- You need nearly 20 target numbers on your sheet plus attack bonuses and ability scores

## Roll High d6/d20 Hybrid

The system used by Dolmenwood and a few other games. High is always better, saves are d20 versus a set target, skills are d6 versus a target that varies by skill/level, ability checks are d6 + ability modifier succeed on 4+.

#### Pro

- Saving throws are unchanged.

- As shown in the chart below the ability check maths works out to be remarkably similar in probability to d20 roll under.

- No conversion required, old modules work as is.

- Roll high is always good.

#### Con

- Attacks, saves, skills and ability checks are still 4 different types of rolls.

- It is hard to keep the skill probabilities the same when you go from d100 to d6 (if like me you aren't a fan of the B/X numbers this might actually be a pro). 

## Target 20

The system I decided on for my (as yet) unpublished B/X hack. Skills, ability checks and saves are all d20 plus modifier and a total of 20 or more is a success.

You can take this further and put hit rolls on the same system though then you have to either add (descending AC) or subtract (ascending AC) armour class from the hit roll.

### Pro

- Universal system for all checks.

### Con

- Clunky maths, or at least you are adding bigger numbers. e.g. a typical ability check might be d20 + 11.

- Takes the straightforward save system and makes it more complicated.

## Bonuses and Ability Saves vs DC

The 5e/Shadowdark solution. Attacks, saves, ability and skill checks are all d20 + bonus versus a DC set by the GM.

### Pro

- Easy to learn for 5e converts.

- Properly unified resolution mechanic.

### Con

- *Either* - Tiny old school bonuses mean stats don't matter.

- *Or* - I just invented [Shadowdark](https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/collections/shadowdark-rpg).

- The GM has to set DCs for everything.

# Did we fix it?

I don't think it can be fixed, at least not by bolting a new mechanic onto B/X. This is why Shadowdark works: the underlying system is solid. While part of me wants to take those old modules and the saving throw numbers and skill rolls as the sacred texts, the truth is that they were all just made up by people doing their best to make a fun game, just like we are.

I prefer Shadowdark's dice mechanics. They are easy to teach, easy to learn, and setting DCs is not that hard with a little practice. However, I think some of the other rules don't work as well if you do want to play older modules and less dungeon crawl focussed games. I want retainers, XP for treasure, better travel rules, and a more nuanced inventory system. I think it makes more sense to take Shadowdark and add those things than it does to take B/X and try and shoehorn in better dice mechanics.
