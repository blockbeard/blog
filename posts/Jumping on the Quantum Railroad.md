description: "The quantum ogre represents everything wrong with railroading: no matter which path players choose, they fight the ogre. But what if it was literally true? Stats for a Tier 2 Daggerheart encounter featuring a probability-warped ogre assassin who exists in multiple quantum states, supported by reality-bending butterflies. Includes full environment features with foreshadowing mechanics. Works as self-aware humor or genuine eldritch threat."

# Quantum Ogres

The concept of a quantum ogre is as old as D&D but it was explained in a post on [Dreams in the Lich House](https://dreamsinthelichhouse.blogspot.com/2011/09/shell-game-in-sandbox.html) and named in a response post on [Hack and Slash](https://hackslashmaster.blogspot.com/2011/09/on-how-illusion-can-rob-your-game-of.html). 
For those unfamiliar with the concept a quantum ogre is when the GM has written an encounter with, for example, an ogre. The party head off on their adventure and have a choice of two paths, they can head through the dark forest, where they will be ambushed by the ogre, or they can head through the mountain path where they will also be ambushed by the ogre. The choice of route is meaningless, the ogre exists in a "quantum" state and when observed will have always been there. 
In the 15 years since the concept was first expounded it has come to be something of a shortcut for taking away player agency. 
When anyone talks about quantum ogres I don't think about agency, or gameism versus simulationism or any of that. I think: is there a statblock? 
If the quantum ogre exists as an entity in the world then all the other questions don't matter, it makes sense in both the fiction and the mechanics of the story that the encounter is inevitable.

I thought it might be fun to make some stats for a Quantum Ogre in [Daggerheart](https://www.daggerheart.com/) since it is my current favourite system, and while we are at it let us give him some friends and an environment too. 

This is a silly encounter designed with humour in mind but hopefully provides enough mechanical rigour to be useful to a Daggerheart GM. 
Daggerheart is a system where the GM can spend their resources to make things happen, and is one of the few systems in which a quantum ogre, in the sense of a scripted encounter the players can't avoid could be played "fairly" by spending fear to bring it about. 

It should suit a light hearted fun table, but you could also play it straight, if you don't lean into the references to quantum physics terms it is just a magical creature. It would work reflavoured as an eldritch horror or demonic summons sent to harass the party. 

## Origin Story
The ogre served the great wizard Mystralos Sophorion. Sophorion was experimenting with probability magic, fascinated with how seemingly minor random changes could lead to very different outcomes. He theorised that if he could make alterations to the laws of probability he could  gain great benefits from only a minor application of magic. 
His research was going well, and he was close to a breakthrough when Khanor the Blessed, a dwarven priest who had been bankrupted by Sophorion testing his probability altering magic during a game of chance chose to have their revenge by dispelling a key component of the experimental containment field. 
The resulting event left both Sophorion's tower and Khanor missing. No one can say whether they were destroyed, transported elsewhere or simply erased from existence. The only survivor being the wizard's ogre servant, who was gathering butterflies for experimentation in the gardens. 
He feels a little odd now, sometimes if something catches his attention he can be mostly an ogre, but when his mind wanders he feels like his head expands and he no longer exists in only one place. In fact there have been verified reports of him being in multiple places at once. 
He has become a Quantum Ogre. 
Along with his quantum butterfly minions he keeps himself occupied using his newfound skills to take on jobs as an assassin and bounty hunter. No matter where his victim seeks to escape he is always there before them. 
# Environment
## Quantum Tunnel

**Tier 2 Event**  
*The party have become the targets of the Quantum Ogre, a confrontation is inevitable.*  
**Impulses:** To bring about the confrontation.  

---
**Difficulty:** 14
**Potential Adversaries:** Quantum Ogre, Quantum Butterflies  

---
### FEATURES
**Many Worlds Interpretation - Passive:** A PC who takes a rest in this environment will be troubled by visions of another version of themselves living lives similar but unlike theirs. On finishing their rest they mark a stress. 
*How is the other life different? What past decision led to the change?*

**Observer Effect - Passive:** When a PC makes an action roll to which they add a trait while another PC can see them, they use the observing PC's trait modifier instead of their own. If more than one can see them then use the closest. 
*How does being observed change the outcome?*

**Uncertainty Principle - Action:** The PCs are approached by a witness who complains of being attacked by an ogre. If questioned by the PCs they will give details but can only remember either where it happened or when. Whichever they explain first they cannot recall anything of the other. 
If the PCs attempt to track the ogre there will be two sets of tracks, both genuine, leading in different directions. If they find other witnesses it will have been spotted in different places at the same time, all parties are telling the truth.
*How can you be sure the witness is sincere despite their apparent confusion?* *How can you tell both sets of tracks are valid?*

**Waveform Collapse - Action:** The Quantum Ogre and its allies reveal themselves to the party, you gain 2 Fear, and the spotlight immediately shifts to one of the adversaries.
# Adversaries
## Quantum Ogre

**Tier 2 Solo**  
*An ogre twisted into something new by a magical accident. There is only one, but quantum effects can make it seem there are more*  
**Motives & Tactics:** crush you, eat your bones  

---
**Difficulty:** 14 | **Thresholds:** 13/27 | **HP:** 8 | **Stress:** 6  
**ATK:** +3 | **Club:** Very Close | 2d12+4 PHY  
**Experience:** Brutal +2  

---
**FEATURES**
**Relentless (2) - Passive:** The ogre can be spotlighted up to two times per GM turn. Spend fear as usual to spotlight them.

**Schrodinger's Splat - Action:** **Mark a Stress** to strike a target within Very Close range. 
The target marks a stress and becomes *Wounded?*
When a *Wounded?* target makes an action roll they clear *Wounded?* and if the roll was with Fear the target takes **2d12+4** direct physical damage.

**Superposition Strike - Action: Spend a Fear** to make an attack against all targets within Close. If the attack succeeds against any of them they all take **2d12+4** physical damage.  

**Spooky Action at a Distance- Reaction:** when the Ogre deals damage with an attack it may force a creature who did not take damage to **mark a stress** as it feels an echo of the pain. 

**Coherent Substitution - Reaction:** if more than one Quantum Ogre is present when this creature marks its last HP another Quantum Ogre clears all its HP and may exchange places with this creature. The Quantum Ogre that cleared its HP is then spotlighted.

## Quantum Butterfly

**Tier 2 Support**  
*A butterfly whose slightest flutter might cause unknown consequences*  

**Motives & Tactics:** Complicate reality, follow the Quantum Ogre  

---
**Difficulty:** 15 | **Thresholds:** 8/18 | **HP:** 3 | **Stress:** 2  
**ATK:** +2 | **Tear reality:** Far | 2d4+3 MAG  
**Experience:** Change by observation +2  

---
**FEATURES**

**Butterfly Effect - Action:** **Mark a Stress** to make an attack roll against a target in far range. On a success deal **2d4+3** magic damage. The next time the target is spotlighted creatures within Close range of them take the same damage.

**Probability Storm - Reaction:** Once per scene, when a PC makes an action roll, swap the values of the hope and fear dice.

## How to use the Quantum Ogre
The environment is meant to take place over a reasonably long time period, perhaps a few days, it mainly foreshadows the strange nature of the ogre and its effects on reality. 
When it comes to building an encounter a solo is worth 5 battle points and a support 1 so I would suggest using multiple ogres and filling in the leftover points with butterflies. 
e.g. A party of 4 provides a budget of 14 battle points, sufficient for two ogres and four butterflies. 
There is only one real ogre but it exists in several quantum states which will collapse down to a single ogre as battle progresses (Coherent Substitution). The butterflies have a high difficulty but are quite fragile with low thresholds and few HP, they should not be hard for a determined PC to take down, but not so easy as minions so be careful not to clump them together too much if your PCs have strong multi-target abilities. They should ideally remain at range and force the players to make difficult choice about their movement and spotlights.
## Final Thoughts
Whether you run it as a self-aware silly encounter with physics puns and math jokes or seriously as a magical assassin I hope you have fun with it, or at least take some inspiration. 
If you try them let me know how it goes, and if you have any ideas how you would build a Quantum Ogre in your favourite system I'd love to hear it.
