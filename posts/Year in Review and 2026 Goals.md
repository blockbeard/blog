description: A look back on my 2025 resolutions and year in gaming and a look forward to next year with goals and accountability
---
This is mostly going to be about TTRPG things, but I do have some personal goals I'm pleased with so I will give them a mention.

- lost 32Kg (5 stone 2 pounds/72lb in different varieties of Imperial units)

- Read 65 books, a mixture of novels, poetry, and non-fiction (not counting TTRPG books or Audiobooks)

- Got diagnosed with ADHD (still awaiting treatment)

- Replaced all my cloud stuff (OneDrive, Google Drive) with a combination of local backups and syncing, and a dedicated off-site backup

But this is a TTRPG blog, so let's talk about that. It was a failure if you look at last year’s resolutions, but was a success if you are more interested in playing in and running good games. So, I think I'll call that a huge success.

I ran 73 sessions:

- 45 Sessions of [Dungeons of Drakkenheim](https://ghostfiregaming.com/dungeons-of-drakkenheim/) using Kobold Press's [Tales of the Valiant,](https://www.talesofthevaliant.com/) we are deep into the campaign and building to an epic conclusion. Tales of the Valiant I have a mixed opinion of but Dungeons of Drakkenheim is fantastic.

- 27 sessions of Spelljammer: Eve of Ruin. A 2024 D&D campaign which started with Spelljammer homebrew, progressed to running the [Light of Xaryxis](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/sais/lox) campaign from the 2022 box set, explored the [Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_Caverns_of_Tsojcanth)and has now moved on to a heavily homebrewed version of [Vecna: Eve of Ruin](https://slyflourish.com/vecna_tears_of_unmaking.html).

- 1 Session of MCDM's [Draw Steel](https://mcdm.gg/rpg). This seems like a fun system and I would like to play more, their custom VTT looks very good, but haven't found the time.

I still want to run more non-5e games but I think more than two regular games is a stretch and I don't do as many one shots and short campaigns as I would like.

I played 116 sessions, an unprecedented number. I have been lucky to be playing in and invited to play in some fantastic games with wonderful people this year, I also played Mad Mage.

- 45 Sessions of [Dolmenwood](https://necroticgnome.com/collections/dolmenwood) with my friend [Patchwork Paladin](https://patchworkpaladin.com/)who really brings this literally fantastic setting to life.

- 22 Sessions of D&D 2014. Dungeon of the Mad Mage. A horrible module I was so glad to have finally finished. I would never have played the whole thing if it wasn't with some good old friends.

- 21 Sessions of [Daggerheart](https://www.daggerheart.com/) mostly with [Arrowed](https://blog.arrowed.games/) who is a great GM who really leans into letting us make shit up. System, GM and players in a wonderful harmony.

- 9 Sessions exploring the [Halls of Arden Vul](https://ardenvul.com/) with Graham Ward being much braver than I and actually running this awe inspiring megadungeon in his [Hundred Dungeons](https://www.darkplane.com/news/2023/12/13/introducing-hundred-dungeons) system.

- 13 sessions of Swords and Sovereigns, a BECMI based system in my friend LichLife's Ermis setting. A hollow world where the physics is questionable but the fun is real.

- 3 Sessions Exploring the Mines of Moria in [LRR 5e](https://freeleaguepublishing.com/shop/the-lord-of-the-rings/)

- 3 different Shadowdark one-shots. One from Cursed Scroll 4, one fast hexcrawl and one venture into a micro megadungeon [The Norn's Judgement](https://ejvc.itch.io/norns-judgement)

- 1 D&D 2024 session playing one of the Dragon Delve adventures

- 1 Session of [Cairn](https://cairnrpg.com/second-edition/), Night at Finhurst Manor.

That's all the good, great games with great people, but how about those resolutions?

Looking back on last year’s resolutions:

**Run my Drakkenheim campaign every week, except weeks with 3+ missing players or if I'm on holiday or something**

A win! I ran 45 sessions and had a great time. We lost one player to schedule changes but have been generally very consistent.

**Run a non-5e campaign (it can be a short one)**

A miss. I only ran one game that wasn't 5e (Tales of the Valiant still counts as 5e IMO).

**Write 2000 words a week. (500 words minimum 4 times)**

A miss. I got very little written. I finished a 1st draft of the quick start guide for my B/X hack and wrote one blog post.

**Do an art every week (paint a mini, bind a book, do a sketch, just something creative)**

Mixed - I have done a few creative projects this year but nothing like weekly.

**Don't buy physical, buy PDF and bind them myself. (except the 5e Monster Manual that is already ordered)**

Started well, and I bought a lot less books than last year but a miss.

**No new PDF until I bound the last one, or properly read it and decided not to**

Again, started well, but I still have a too-large to read pile.

In hindsight I'm not sure these were that achievable, mainly because I have no mechanism for review or accountability.

I am struggling with resolutions this year, I have a few things I want to achieve generally but many of them aren't really in my control or relevant to a TRPG blog so let’s concentrate on ones that are.

Gaming wise I am very happy to have 2 fantastic groups I play in and one I GM for.

I want to run a megadungeon, it has been on my bucket list for a while and this is going to be the year there are also lots of shiny products on my shelf looking at me begging to be run. Rather than jump the gun and burn myself out trying to run 3 campaigns I'm going to wait until the ones I'm running now finish before starting any big ones. But when they do, I will commit to a megadungeon, current thinking is [Caverns of Thracia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Caverns_of_Thracia) with an OD&D retro clone, and something cheerful, maybe a Daggerheart game in the [Obojima](https://obojima.com/) setting. 

In the meantime, I'm going to stick with one shots and short campaigns, I'm organising a [His Majesty the Worm](https://www.hismajestytheworm.games/) one-shot and eyeing up [Nightmare over Ragged Hollow](https://www.themerrymushmen.com/product/nightmare-over-ragged-hollow/) as a short campaign. I might also see if I can fit in some more Draw Steel, it should need very little prep if I use the VTT.

I still want to write more, I'd like to publish some TTRPG things this year, I have a couple of ideas for short supplements and would like to get a couple of adventures done. I'm also going to do a megadungeon challenge, a room a day, in the style of [Dungeon23](https://itch.io/jam/dungeon23). 

Let's see if we can make that into something more structured and figure out how I'm going to keep myself accountable.

### Specific Measurable Attainable Relevant and Time-Bound Goals

1. Start running a megadungeon within a month of one of my current campaigns ending

2. Run a one-shot or short campaign in a system other than D&D 5e every quarter

3. Publish two short supplements by December 2026

4. Create 365 dungeon rooms in 2026, 300+ counts as a success

5. Publish one Blog post per month in 2026

### Review and Accountability

Setting a reminder on my calendar now to review my progress a week before the end of each month and another to review at the end of each quarter. If I am significantly off track after a quarterly review, I'll change my goals and post about it.

Accountability is harder, a monthly blog post reviewing my progress might work but I don't want to have my blog be a record of my new year’s resolutions that doesn't seem very interesting for readers. I will post a monthly update on the [Sly Flourish](https://slyflourish.com/) Discord server on the last day of the month.

In addition, if anyone wants to be my accountability buddy hit me up and I'll ask you how your goals are going every month in return for you asking about mine. 

OK, let's do this!

Happy New Year for 2026, lets crush some goals.
